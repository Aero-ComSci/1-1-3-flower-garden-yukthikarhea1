# What is this code?: Basically what this code does is that it allows the user to ask for any type of flower, with a variety of 5, and whatever they ask for, the flowers will show up to them. The number of flowers can vary and the number of flowers they wish for and variety will also show up. 

# What we learned: We were able to be really creative and use different functions to make sure the number of flowers they ask for shows up on the screen. This really helped us make the code easier and efficent. We also learned how to space things out while displaying the flwoers on the screen to try and make it look appealing to the others. 

# What we are happy about: We are very happy that we were able to do something that we never thought we would be able to do. We were able to use different functions and a variety of code to create flowers and showcase them to the users. We are happy that even though we came across a lot of challeneges and test running because of our code breaking, we were very dedicated and stayed focused to create something we never thought we could.
